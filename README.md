# Paper-Replications

In this repository I will be replicating ML/DL/AI Papers and Model Architecture from Scratch using PyTorch. 

I will keep this file updated on how many models implemented so far. 

## Vision Models:

* [ ] [DDPM] - implementation of DDIM and DDPM is the same however only the noising process of the image is different. DDIM is faster.
* [ ] [cGAN]
* [ ] ViT (Vision Transfomer)
* [ ] CLiP

## Text Models and LLMs:

* [X] [Transformer]
* [ ] [BERT]

## Models Trained and Tested So far:
